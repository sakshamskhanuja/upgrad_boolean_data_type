## Boolean Data Type

### Description

Let’s say someone is booking an air ticket for himself and his brother. There is an offer that says that he will get a 20% discount if both he and his brother are less than 25 years old.

Write a code that prints ‘true’ if he is eligible for the offer and ‘false’ if he is not eligible.

Specifically, the program should -

1. Ask the user to enter his age
2. Ask the user to enter the age of his brother
3. Store the ages of the user and the user’s brother
4. Print "true" if the user is eligible for the discount or "false" if the user is not eligible for the discount
5. Please note that age has to be non- negative.
6. So, in case the user enters the age which is less than or equal to 0, the program should return false.

### Input

25 28

### Output

false
